# DistantEngine

Welcome to the DistantEngine. This is a game engine library to make the production of dungeon crawlers, sidescrollers, 2D RPG's and any other 2D game easier.
By acting as the interface/binding between your game and SDL2, this library will make your job a whole lot easier by abstracting away the majority of the little functions.

This will be my Major Project for my IT class, however it may also be a project which I still work on afterwards.
